# Heart Sound Denoising using 1D U-Net

## 📌 Project Summary

This project implements a deep learning solution for denoising heart sound recordings (Phonocardiograms - PCG) using a 1D U-Net architecture.  
The model takes noisy heart audio recordings and outputs a cleaned version by suppressing background and environmental noise.  
It is intended for use in digital stethoscopes, clinical diagnostics, and medical research.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Improve clarity in noisy PCG recordings
- Preserve diagnostic heart features such as S1, S2, and murmurs
- Enable low-latency processing for real-time applications
- Provide a reproducible, open-source medical denoising baseline

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a 1D U-Net architecture, composed of:

- **Encoder**: Series of Conv1D + MaxPooling1D layers to extract features
- **Decoder**: UpSampling1D layers with skip connections to reconstruct the signal
- **Custom Layer**: `MatchLength1D` ensures skip connections align in time
- **Input shape**: (110250, 1) → 5 seconds at 22.05 kHz
- **Output shape**: (110250, 1)

## 🚀Getting Started

1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run Inference
Replace `your_noisy_file.wav` with your input audio:
```bash
python src/inference.py --input your_noisy_file.wav --output denoised.wav
```
3. Train the Model (Optional)
```bash
python src/train_unet.py
```

## 🔮Future Improvements

-Add a real-time denoising interface
-Visualize spectrograms (before vs after)
-Add evaluation pipeline (SNR, waveform alignment)
-Create a REST API or deploy on mobile devices
